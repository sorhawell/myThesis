\chapter{Diabetes Type-2 and Oral Insulin}


\textit{"Diabetes is one of the first diseases described with an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE mentioning "too great emptying of the urine." The first described cases are believed to be of type 1 diabetes. Indian physicians around the same time identified the disease and classified it as madhumeha or honey urine noting that the urine would attract ants. The term "diabetes" or "to pass through" was first used in 230 BCE by the Greek Apollonius Of Memphis. The disease was rare during the time of the Roman empire with Galen commenting that he had only seen two cases during his career. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400â€“500 AD with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight. The term "mellitus" or "from honey" was added by the Briton John Rolle in the late 1700s to separate the condition from diabetes insipidus which is also associated with frequent urination. Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when the Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin in 1921 and 1922. This was followed by the development of the long acting NPH insulin in the 1940s."}

\section{Diabetes}
Diabetes type-1 is defined as the inability to produce insulin due to the not fully understood auto-immune rejection of the insulin producing beta-cells. The typical onset of Type-1 diabetes is at child age or youth. Insulin is an important hormone for regulation of the human metabolism, as it promotes uptake of glucose in the liver, muscles and fat tissue. A oscillating level of insulin is required to regulate the energy metabolism during the day. Shortly after a meal, insulin is released to signal start taking up glucose. In fasting state, insulin levels in healthy persons are low, as no new glucose is obtained from digestion. Insulin has an oppositely acting counterpart, glucagone, that promotes release of glucose primarily from the liver. Type-2 diabetes is defined by insulin resistance, where the peripheral tissues and the liver do not respond sufficiently to the endogenous produced insulin. When blood glucose levels exceeds 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL), the kidney can no longer re-uptake all glucose from the excreted urine. The glucose in urine will sequentially increase osmolality and prevent the kidney from reabsorbing water as well and hence the higher rate of sweet urine and the name diabetes mellitus. A healthy human can regulate the blood sugar within 3.9 mmol/L and 7.8 mmol/L throughout a normal day cycle. After the meals of the day, the food is metabolized and free glucose comes into blood circulation. Without regulation, a single meal would make the blood sugar far exceed normal levels\cite{silverthorn2010human,Cowart1990}.
To put these numbers in to perspective, ideally elevating the blood glucose from 3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L for adult of 80 kg and 8 liters of blood would only require
$ \frac { (7.8-3.9) \textrm{mmol/L} \quad 180\textrm{mg/dL} }
		{ 10 \textrm{mmol/L} } = 5.3 \textrm{g}$ of glucose.

The pancreas located adjacent to the first part of the intestine after the stomach senses systemic blood sugar levels. The pancreas can also receive hormone signal from the adjacent small intestines (e.g. GLP-1), that food currently is being metabolised and systemic blood sugar soon will rise. Thus, whenever needed under and after a meal, the pancreas will release insulin. Insulin triggers a number of blood glucose lowering responses, rendering cellular uptake and storage of glucose. Glucose is stored short-term in the liver and muscles and in part converted to fat and stored long-term in fatty tissues. The liver is the major short term energy storage, taking up glucose and converting it to polymeric glucogen, that subsequently when needed can be converted into glucose and released again. For type-2 patients, insulin secretion is constantly elevated to compensate the insulin resistance, and therefore the pancreas cannot further regulate the glucose load from a meal, as it is already producing insulin almost as fast as possible \cite{silverthorn2010human}. A glucose tolerance test is used to diagnose diabetes. Figure \cref{intro_glucoseTolerance} outlines a glucose tolerence test and the response from a healthy subject as well as for a type-1 and type-2 diabetic patient. A type-1 diabetic patient will have no endogenous regulation of blood sugar and both long acting and well timed short acting insulin therapy is needed. Due to uncertainties of timing and bio-availability oral insulin therapy. Oral insulin can only cover the basel level of insulin. As type-1 diabetics is already treating themselves with injectable short-aciting insulin in conjunction with meals, there is no rationale in replacing there long acting basal insulin injectable formulation with an oral formulation. In contrary for type-2 diabetics who would only need a basal insulin therapy to assist their pancreas in regulating the blood glucose, an oral insulin therapy would be convenient option to have.

Type-2 accounts for the most incidents of diabetes and is strongly associated with lack of physical exercise, an unfavorable diet and obesity. Other risk factors are age and genetic predispositions. Type-2 diabetes is not only a problem in industrialized countries.  World-wide 380 million people are estimated to have diabetes world wide and attributable to 15\% of deaths. \cite{aguiree2013idf}.

Intensive anti-diabetic therapy is important to avoid or delay myocardial infarct, micro vascular diseases and kidney related complications \cite{holman,boussageon2011effect,gaede2008effect}. Having a chronic elevated high blood glucose is simply very unhealthy long-term and will reduce the quality of life. As the type-2 diabetes progress, glyceamic control is no longer achievable with a single oral agent such as Metformin or Sulfonylurea, which receptively lowers insulin resistance and increases endogenous insulin production. Injectable formulations of insulin-analogues or GLP-1-analogues will inevitably be considered at some point in the progression. Inconvenience and patient compliance are the main factors for not achieving the clinical recommendations for blood glucose control in insulin treatment of type II diabetes patients. To initiate injectable insulin therapy is a psychological barrier for Type-2 patients and a cause of worrying \cite{korytkowski2002oral}. Neverthelses insulin therapy will eventually become the outcome for most Type-2 patients. From early onset type-2 patients still have the ability to regulate blood sugar to some level and strict hourly control is not needed. In two groups group of 24,000 and 10,000 patients of seniors aged 60-69 (where), the former group was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes within last 9 years and the ladder group has been diagnosed for more than 9 year. When recently diagnosed, patients are prescribed oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA). 50\% of early diagnosed received metformin and/or sulfonylurea. Only 7.5\% received insulin treatment. In contrary, for patients diagnosed for more than 9 years fully 65\% are ordinated treatments based on injectable insulin \cite{Elbert2014rates}. Thus a typical type-2 diabetes disease progression will start with fairly convenient once a day tablets, mildly lowering glucose. With time, more potent insulin is needed to obtain sufficient blood glucose control. The disease will progress from the needed treatment is only complimenting the blood sugar regulating mechanisms of the body itself, to the insulin therapy will be the main regulation of blood glucose.

Compliance is the extent of which the patient uses the medicine as prescribed by the physician. Especially for short acting injectable insulins, daily awareness and monitoring of blood glucose and having injectable insulin pens refrigerated may be a huge requirement for the patient. Type-1 patients who came to master these skills early in life, are likely to have a much higher compliance.

Simply, the patient must learn to live by a fairly complex treatment regimen late in life. Compliance for only oral agents can be as low is 50\% after six months \cite{garcia2013adherence}. As the disease progress, patients are expected to need injectable insulin at some point. In a study 50\% of insulin-naive patients percieved injectable insulin inititaion as a failure. In a study, of those patients who did not comply to an treatment regime with injectable insulin, the most common reasons given were planing to improve healthy behavior (25\%), fear of injection (13\%), negative impact on work (9\%), concerns on long-term medication (9\%), inconvenience (6\%), and not believing insulin was necessary (6\%). Despite the available various available anti diabetic agents for various stages of type-2, it is indicated that less than 50\% of patients achieve the aimed glucose control recommended and around two-thirds will die prematurely of cardiovascular disease \cite{garcia2013adherence}. In contrary it is argued that current injection pens actually have improved comfort for insulin injection so much, that needle fobia alone is not at strong argument for developing oral insulin formulations \cite{maher2014formulation}.

The possible introduction of oral insulin may provide a mid-way solution especially for Type-2 patients where other oral agents no longer are potent enough, yet with the same ease of administration as oral agents. Thus oral insulin may prolong the time the patient can regulate blood sugar without injectable insulin and perhaps improve compliance.

\section{Drug Development Challanges of Oral Insulin}

Oral formulations of insulin is not an obviously great idea. From natures side, an organism tend not take up any foreign substances, and certainly not foreign proteins or peptides. Proteins taken up are likely produced by foreign species, and therefore have been created to serve independent purposes, that not necessarily are in alignment with the survival of the organism.
Likewise, the human body have a series of barriers in the gastrointestinal tract before proteins such as insulin, reach systemic circulation. Figure \cref{intro_glucoseTolerance} illustrates the upper gastrointestinal tract and the barriers for insulin. Normal protein absorption, or more correctly amino acid absorption, starts in the stomach with the enzyme pepsin cleaving protein amide-bonds next to lipophilic/aromatic amino acids. Insulin formulations are simply protected towards pepsin and acidic hydrolysis with an acid insoluble tablet coating. The coating is made of polymers with pH-dependent solubility. Acidic side groups will deprotonate only under neutral pH and increase the solubility of otherwise lipophilic polymers. \cite{carino1999oral,gabor2010improving}. Most coatings are designed to dissolve at pH > 5.5 \cite{maher2014formulation}.
The insulin producing gland, pancreas, is also very central to the gastro intestinal digestion. The sphincther, the opening muscle of the stomach, forward some of the stomach content to the upper duodenum. The pancreas will secrete to the pancreatic duct the alkaline carbonate to neutralize the hydrochloric stomach acid. Pepsin is deactivated by neutral pH, while neutral acting trypsin and chymotrypsin are released from the pancreas as well. Depending on thickness and acid groups of coating polymer, the tablet/capsule will start dissolving immediately in the duodenum and jejunum or as late as in the colon.

The stomach empties approximately only every 50-120 minutes during fasting and even longer for diabetic patient \cite{silverthorn2010human,corvilain1995effect,gabor2010improving}, the accuracy of timing the dose are not likely to match injectable insulin. Therefore, oral insulin is not likely to replace fast acting well timed doses of injectables used by type-1 diabetics in connection with meals. Oral insulin is most likely to replace longer acting insulins where the exact onset of action is of less concern.

The luminal enzyme activity by trypsin and chymotrypsin will likely inactivate released insulin in less than 5-15 minutes \cite{welling2014citric}.

Presently several oral insulin formulation are clinical phase two and three. These formulation can rely on protein backbone modification to make insulin intrinsic more stable to enzymatic degradation, absorption enhancers, enzyme inhibitors (soybean, citric acid) and micro/nano-encapsulated carriers \cite{aguirre2016current}. Oral delivery of other peptides such as glukagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, salmon calcitonin, octreotide (somatostain agonist), parathyroid hormone are also in clinical development in 2012.

Peptide API's in oral formulations targeting systemic circulation, that have been approved by FDA or EMA are Cyclosporin (MW 1200) Desmopressin (MW 1100), Taltirelin Taltirelin  (MW 500) and glutathione (MW 300). \cite{aguirre2016current}. The reason these four API have been successfully introduced to market before insulin are likely in part the significant smaller size than monomere insulin (MW 6000) and these peptides can therefore permeate the epithelial barrier more easily. 


With the current formulation technology it is only possible to do so much. \quote{"The selection of a suitable peptide for oral formulation is, therefore, a key commercial decision. For example, selecting a complex, high molecular weight (MW), narrow therapeutic index peptide, manufactured by a costly recombinant approach, requiring multiple daily oral administrations would be problematic."}

Maher \textit{et al} points out that oral peptide delivery  for decades have been in its infancy and that we cannot suddenly deliver any type of peptide. In fact the current achievements are more attributable to the biotechnological advances allowing modification of the peptide and cheap production.

Pharmacokinetic profiles. Treatment with injectable peptides such as insulin, GLP-1 and growth hormone have become more convenient the last decades, as the intrinsic endogenous hormone have been modified to increase the half-life. Hereby, patients treated with a constant level of hormone, only have to inject themselves daily or even weekly. Oral peptides formulations at first will likely be attempted switches from their prenatally-marketed counterparts \cite{maher2014formulation}. As only a couple of percentages of peptide is likely absorbed the relative variation of absorption are potentially very high \cite{gabor2010improving}. A dosing interval significantly shorter than the half-life of the drug is a classic method for maintaining a relatively constant drug concentration within the therapeutic window \cite{tozer2006introduction}.

Analogues with enzymatic stability is also required. Co-formulation of soy-bean enzyme inhibitors \cite{fujii1985promoting}, covalent peptide protecters (SNAC) \cite{bruno2013basics}, pH lowering \cite{welling2014citric} can only lower degradation 2 to 5-fold. Designing stable analogues is also needed to obtain sufficient stability. PEGylation, cyclization and modification of back-bone structure are know approaches to increase intrinsic peptide analogue stability \cite{bruno2013basics}.

Thirdly peptide or proteins have to pass the epithelial barrier. Insulin (MW 6000 D) is likely near the upper limit of the size. For Octertide, it was possible to remove select a small part of peptide still retaining activity \cite{aguiree2013idf}. 

Fatty acids C8 to C12 have been to open tight junction between epithelial cells and mildly perturb the phospholipid membrane of the epithelials cells. There have been an extensive research {cite also brayden, c10, CMC} \cite{bruno2013basics} uncovering how C10 regulate calcium levels, and phosphyrolation cascades of the epithelial cells leading to opening of TJ. Nontheless, inorder to obtain a suffcient response C10 have to be presented on intestinal lumen in concentrations close to the critical micelle contration (which is) where the perturbing effect on phospholipid membrane sets in \cite{bruno2013basics}. No specific technology increasing protein absorption significantly have emerged from the C10-Calcium-TJ-theory. In practice fatty acids are surfactants, and most surfactants will destabilize the epithelial membrane and promote peptide absorption. The important part is how wide are the therapeutic window, potency versus toxicity and are these surfactant sufficiently soluble. Biological effects such as the C10-Calcium-TJ theory may render one surfactant slightly more or less potent and such effect would be difficult to predict, see section (modelling assumptions). The working hypothesis of this thesis is that central properties of surfactants are fairly possible to predict as they arise from non-complex physical phenomenas, and new absorption enhancers could be discovered simply from the expected structure.

Other solid state surfactant like enhancers tested for absorption enhancement. In common these enhancers all have a mono acyl chain typically from 8 to 16 carbon atoms. Other groups surfactant enhancers are the acyl-carnitines, acyl-cholates\cite{lee2000oral}, phosphocholines\cite{liu1999dodecylphosphocholine}, acyl-maltosides \cite{petersen2013colonic} and acyl sulphate \cite{anderberg1993epithelial}.

\section{Studies to test peptide absorption}
The overall goal for an oral formulation is to achieve a high bio-availability with low a variance. That is to maximize the percentage of dose absorbed, and to minimize the day-to-day variance. However in order to learn how a formulation attempt may be failing, it is needed to break down the process into individual steps. The typical three steps to consider are dissolution of the tablet, enzymatic stability and permeation enhancement. The article first article, \textit{"The role of citric acid in oral peptide and protein formulations: Relationship between calcium and proteolysis inhibition."} \cite{welling2014citric}, included in this thesis is good example of the \textit{in vitro} methods used to evaluate permeation enhancement and enzymatic stability. First the three steps can be understood as a link. If one is failing the overall result will be poor.

Studies to test permeation enhancement ranging from early proof-of-concept development to clinical trials late every are listed in Figure \ref{typeOfExperiment}. Beyond this list focusing on peptide permeation studies, also dedicated studies of \textit{in vitro} dissolution, peptide stability and toxicology would e.g. be required.

((membrane transport/electrical resistance image?))

In preclinical development, studies are formally segregated in two categories the \textit{ex vivo} outside the living and the \textit{in vivo} inside the living organism. Often \textit{in vivo} refer to animal studies, not human. The term \textit{in vitro}, in reagent glass, is used instead of \textit{ex vivo}. Speaking of \textit{in silico}, in silicium, is used for computer models. One may feel the latin buzzword terminology has been overly used to a point no longer being \textit{in}. Further there are clinical trials in human. It is obviously sensible to test many new insulin analogues and formulations in fairly inexpensive and fast studies. The three main properties of oral formulations to optimize are named  solubility, enzymatic stability and epithelial permeability. Most medical research observe and propose general causal mechanisms. Where clinical trials can be very representative for the intended population of patients, it is difficult to learn exactly why a therapy elicited no positive result. The multiple potential steps of failure cannot be observed. Moreover, negative confirmation is important to narrow in what part of a therapy is essential for a positive outcome. Ethical considerations limit clinical trials to prescribe therapies to patients in conflict with their best self interest. With \textit{in vivo} studies it is possible to test treatments as long as the animal suffering is kept minimal. Still the gastro-intestinal tract is a complicated machinery and it is not possible to control or measure every aspect the peptide absorption process. Moreover other sources of variance such as the individual variance in animal physiology may introduce noise into measurements. The animal variance makes a step-wise incremental optimization of formulation challenging, as it becomes hard to evaluate what works, due to no significant change of bioavailability. The lab bench \textit{in vitro} experiments offers close to full control of the experiment conditions. These experiments are often fast and or of low cost, while the reproducibility and statistical power are high. From a modeling perspective a larger set observations number is needed, especially for non-linear machine learning, see \ref{some section}. Therefore to get hands on a large set of \textit{in vitro} data is more easy. The \textit{in vitro} experiments can often be crude and it is accepted as a necessary evil, that the conditions do not exactly represent completely a clinical situation. Figure \ref{typeOfExperiment} listing the range of permeation experiments, is intended reflect this conflict between representative studies and elucidating studies.
When training machine learning models on data from \textit{in vitro} experiments, we only expect the model to reflect the experiment. With a hopefully sufficient theoretical understanding of the overall peptide absorption and the various biases of the \textit{in vitro} experiments, we can hopefully place the model in a context to obtain useful predictions and identify potential causal relationships between formulation and outcome.

\subsection{Caco-2 monolayers}
Caco-2 monolayers have been a standard screening method for intestinal drug permeability. The Caco-2 permeation model, as other permeation models, consist of a donor chamber, an epithelial barrier and a reciever chamber. Caco-2 monolayers are colonic human cancer cells, which a much more prolific and easy to handle, than primary epithelial cells. When seeded on a 2 cm in diameter micro porous filter on a 12-well plate, the Caco-2 cell line will grow and form a epithelial monolayer in two weeks. A typical test will use 4 monolayers per tested treatment and the study is to be repeated on a different day. During the test, the nutrient reach growth media is replaced with a minimal buffer solution. The buffer solution only contain a physiological level of electrolytes such as calicium, potassium, sodium, chloride and phosphate plus an acid/base buffer. These ions maintain isotonicity and a normal electrical membrane potential. Active membrane transporter receptors in the epithelial membrane rely on a given correct membrane potential. Within standard drug development of small molecules, a low permeability result would likely lead discarding the given analogue, as it easier to find a new analogue with a favorable permeability. In insulin therapy, there are few alternatives to insulin-like analogues and therefore the low permeability must alleviated by formulation. To use Caco-2 monolayers to test absorption enhancers for oral peptide delivery make up, just a small part of the use of Caco-2 monolayers. Here the permeability of insulin is already low, and may be increased by a given absorption enhancer. For surfactant enhancers at high concentration, the monolayer can become completely disrupted, while at low concentration no useful effect is observed.

\subsection{Measuring permeability}
To estimate how potent an permeation enhancer is, permeation markers have been used. An obvious marker is human insulin itself, but insulin is difficult to handle and quantification by immuno-assay can be expensive. A number of of alternative permeation markers are typically used to substitute or compliment insulin. One of these are C$_14$ or H$_3$ isotope labeled mannitol. Mannit, approximately as hydrophilic as glucose, is thought to only diffuse passively via the paracellular pathway through the tight-junctions \cite{anderberg1992epithelial,artursson1994effect}. Mannitol is neither taken up by active transport as glucose would be. Also, trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) can measure how open the paracellular tight junctions are, as the junction cross sectional area is approximately proportional to the conductivity, and conductivity is inverse resistance. TEER is the easiest non-invasive measurement. Lowering the epithelial resistance e.g. 50\% with an absorption enhancer will likely translate to a (?-fold increase) of permeability of both mannitol and insulin. FITC-dextran 4000 dalton (FD4) is a florescent labeled sugar polymer of similar hydrophilicity and size as insulin. FD4 can replace insulin as transport marker except it has no enzymatic instability.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\label{devel_typeOf}
\includegraphics{graphics/typeOfExperiments.pdf}
\caption{Schematic overview of types of experiments ranging from Caco-2 to clinical. Simple experiments to not accurately simulate the actual process, and there will be a number of biases which must not be over interpreted.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Calculating permeability}
Gradient driven diffusion of mannitol, FD-4 and insulin across the epithelial barrier is a first order process where the transport per time is proportional to the concentration gradient $C_i$ ($mol/L$). Only a few percent of the total amount of transport marker will permeate the barrier and therefore will $C_i$ be approximately unchanged throughout the experiment. Hereby becomes the apparent permeability $P_{app}$ proportional to the transport rate or flux $J$ ($mol/s$) which is usually estimated by sampling the reciever basolateral side 4 to 6 times. When plotting reciever concentration versus time, a fitted ordinary least squares slope is used as the overall transport rate through out the experiment. Permeability is corrected for the cross sectional area of the chamber. The flux $J$ is expected to be proportional to the cross sectional area of the chamber $A$ (cm$^2$).  Therefore the apparent permeability is written caluculated as

$P_\{app\} = J/A/C_i = \frac{dC_r}{dt}/A/C_i \quad ,$

where $\frac{dC_r}{dt}$ is the slope of ordinary least squares regression of receiver chamber concentration versus time. The intercept with x-axis (time) is interpretted as the lag time, the time it takes saturate the thin unstirred water layer and the epithelial. The lag time is typically a couple of minutes depending in Cac-2 and ussing chamber. To observe a nearly constant flux e.g. throughout a one hour experiment is normal. On one side is the small change in concentration gradient decreasing some few percent throughout the study. On the other side it is possible that the actual permeability of the epithelial barrier is increasing through the one hour flux study due to slow deterioration by the absorption enhancer. As a rather constant flux is observed, perhaps these to effects cancel each other out. In control epithelial barriers with absorption enhancer treatment, the barrier integrity is not expected to decline, but at the same time the flux is very low, so the concentration gradient do not change.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\label{meassure_TEERPapp}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{graphics/sketch_measuring_permeability.png}
\caption{Illustration of how \textit{(a)} P$_{app}$ and \textit{(a)}  TEER is calculated.}
\end{figure}


The tight junctions are in theory water filled channels with a given specific conductance of the solute. When tight junction are widened, the cross-sectional area of tight-junction per area tissue is changed. Similarly as marker transport is driven by a concentration difference, the electrical current $A_{e}$ (Ampere $A_c$) is driven by an electrical potential difference $U$ (Voltage V). The tissue conductivity $S$ corrected for area tissue $S_A = S/A$, is the equivalent to $P_{app}$. The electrical charge permeability is described in TEER (trans epithelial electrical resistance). TEER (Ohm cm$^2$) is the inverse $S_A$ with units.

$frac{1}{RA} = S_A = A_e/A / U \quad$

To summarize both $P_app$ and inverse TEER both describe how readily a flux of either molecules or ions are driven through the epithelial barrier by respectively a concentration gradient or a electrical potential gradient. $P_app$ is measured by maintaining a constant concentration gradient determining the molecule flux. TEER is either measured with voltage or current clamping. To measure TEER with voltage clamping is to control the electrical gradient (potential difference) with electrodes and measuring the actual current. Current clamping is oppositely to drive a specified flux of ions (current) through the epithelial barrier and record the electrical gradient. TEER reflects the inverse para-cellular permeability of the monolayers. For direct measurement of permeability of a given drug molecule, TEER is mainly used to check barrier integrity. For measuring the potency of permeation enhancers to increase permeability, TEER can be used as indicator hereof. To directly measure the permeation of insulin would be preferable, but this is more slow, expensive and unlikely to find in already published results. As the current and potential difference can be manipulated with electrodes, the time resolution for TEER measurements are in seconds. The time resolution for permeation markers is limited by the sampling rate and accuracy of the concentration determination. The sampling rate of Caco-2 studies are typically once per 10 or 15 minutes.
