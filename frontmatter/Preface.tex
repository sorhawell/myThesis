\chapter{Preface}
This Ph.D. thesis was prepared at the department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark in fulfillment of the requirements for acquiring a Industrial Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

A number of figures from third party sources have been copied or reproduced in thesis accordingly to the guide lines \textit{Keep your thesis legal} \cite{johnson2015keeping}. For any figure stated as copied, I am not the copy right holder, and I have included the figure as less than a substantial part of someone others work, to make a specific point. Other figures are either my creations, reproductions and/or copied from public available sources or mix of all three and can be copied and modified freely..
